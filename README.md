##  Data Collection & Cleaning

###  Data Source  
- **Official Website:** Election Commission of India (ECI) – Results Portal  
- **Method:** Automated web scraping (Python: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium)  
- **Verification:** Manual validation checks for accuracy & consistency  

###  Cleaning Steps Performed

- Standardized column names  
- Removed duplicates  
- Parsed and cleaned numeric fields  
- Filled missing values appropriately  
- Converted invalid or inconsistent entries  
- Prepared a final clean dataset ready for EDA & ML

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook `02_eda_visualization.ipynb` includes:

- Distribution of votes  
- Vote percentage analysis  
- Party-wise performance comparison  
- EVM vs Postal votes comparison  
- Winning margin distribution  
- Constituency-level behavior analysis  
- Heatmaps, histograms, boxplots & bar charts  

Example questions explored:

- Which parties performed best across regions?  
- How competitive were the constituencies?  
- How many candidates received <5% vote share?  
- What patterns exist between EVM vs postal votes?

##  Feature Engineering

The `03_feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook covers:

- Vote share ratios  
- Postal vote contribution  
- Party encoding (one-hot / frequency encoding)  
- Constituency-level aggregations  
- Handling high-cardinality categories  
- Creating an ML-ready dataset

##  Machine Learning (Optional)

Optional ML experiments include:

### Tasks
- **Classification:** Predict winning party/candidate  
- **Regression:** Predict total votes or vote share  

### Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Linear Regression  

These provide baseline models for analyzing constituency trends and vote patterns.
